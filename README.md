# MNIST Classification


Welcome to `Convolutional Neural Networks` again!

In this challenge, we will play with the MNIST Dataset.

You will design your first Convolutional Neural Network to recognizise handwritten digits. Have fun!

*Notes*:
- Estimated time to complete: 45-60 min
- Spoiler alert: you will achieve an incredible accuracy above 95%, but don't expect such a high number in real life :D
